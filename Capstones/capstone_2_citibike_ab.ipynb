    "Add upgrades to some bikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "POSSIBLE UPGRADES:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Smart Halo https://www.amazon.com/SmartHalo-Accessory-Navigation-Anti-Theft-Speedometer/dp/B071WMZFFZ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=travgadg-20&linkId=a7a40618b96e6ab2ff2f2b472a2ec804&language=en_US\n",
    "\n",
    "This gadget turns bikes into smartbikes. Guides you around via GPS, __tracks your fitness goals__, has an automatic night light and even has a personal assistant that can answer wuestions or take phone calls.\n",
    "I believe the fitness tracking aspect alone will lead to longer and/or more frequent rides.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Attached Bluetooth Speaker (any). Example: https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Speaker-System-Celtic-Blu/dp/B01LY6UKCL/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=travgadg-20&linkId=2974c6a27ad05e05612d2a99839fa8fa&language=en_US\n",
    "\n",
    "This will increase enjoyment on bike rides, especially for those without headphones or other means of listening to music while riding. Could potentially increase duration of bike rides.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Improved Seat Cushion (any) (cheap). Example: https://www.amazon.com/Zacro-Cover-BS031-Extra-Bicycle/dp/B01H71AZ36/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1522178670&sr=8-19&keywords=bike+accessories&linkCode=sl1&tag=brobible-20&linkId=429446966a8fec33e28c7bb14ccb2eef\n",
    "\n",
    "A more comfortable seat can definitely increase trip duration. From my own experience, Citi Bike seats are not the most comfortable and can leade to shorter trips when being ridden for leisure/tourism purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Light System (any). Example: https://www.amazon.com/revolights-skyline-bicycle-lighting-27-inch/dp/b00o50tuse\n",
    "\n",
    "Equipping bikes with lights will make night-riding more viable and therefore increase total trips.\n",
    "\n",
    "__WRITE UP OUTLINE:__\n",
    "\n",
    "Upgrade(s) will be added to select bikes throughout the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "For 1-month experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, 10% of bikes will be modified for first two weeks, then up to 50% for the next two weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will obviously vary based on budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of tracking the data, a column will be added to determine if a certain bikeid had been modified, and a cost column will be added to track revenue of each trip, assuming each trip is a single ride (for simplicity & lack of specification within data) and accounting for overage penalties __DEMONSTRATED BELOW__\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the experimentation period, revenue generated by trips with modified vs unmodified bikes (daily, weekly, etc) will be compared with a T-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "A P-value greater than .05 will show that there is a significant increase in revenue generated by upgraded bikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this experiment we will be testing Citi Bike upgrades in NYC in order to see if they have a positive effect on Citi Bike useage and therefore profits, as well as any resulting impact on other local means of transportation such as taxis or ride sharing. These changes can benefit the company and potentially benefit the environment if more bikes are being used as opposed to polluting transportation methods."
