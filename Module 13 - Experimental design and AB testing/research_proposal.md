When people install the Happy Days Fitness Tracker app, they are asked to "opt in" to a data collection scheme where their level of physical activity data is automatically sent to the company for product research purposes. During your interview with the company, they tell you that the app is very effective because after installing the app, the data show that people's activity levels rise steadily.

__The Problem:__

We need to prove that our fitness app is superior in increasing users' level of physical activity.

__The Potential Solution:__

By comparing our app to other similar fitness apps, we can show that ours produces a higher level of physical activity in users.

__The method of testing the solution:__

Take a randomly split pool of fitness enthusiasts.
All ages, weights, etc split equally between groups.
One group uses our fitness app for a week, 2 weeks, a month, etc.
The other group(s) do the same with the other app(s).
Data will be compared between group participants such as avg activity time per month, calories burned, app use frequency, etc.
If our numbers are at least, say, 5% higher than competitors', we can claim that ours is the superior fitness app on the market.
