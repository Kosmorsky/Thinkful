For each of the following questions, outline how you could use an A/B test to find an answer. 
Be sure to identify all five key components of an A/B test we outlined above.



__Does a new supplement help people sleep better?__

Hypothesize that the supplement WILL improve sleep for most people.
Wonder if there will be any side effects?

A sample of people is selected who are having trouble sleeping.
Sample is randomly split into two groups.
One group takes the supplement for a period of time, the other does not.
After this period, the groups swap roles and proceed for the same length of time.

All persons are then asked if they noticed better sleep when taking the supplement vs when not.
All persons are asked if they experienced any side effects when taking the supplement.



__Will new uniforms help a gym's business?__

Hypothesize that new uniforms WILL improve business (increase # of customers).
Will different uniforms attract different types of people/demographics to the gym?

If 1 location...
Designate a period of time where business is usually consistent.
Start wearing uniforms during this period and see if there is a rise in business that is out of the ordinary.
After (if) a rise is observed, switch back to old uniforms and see if business decreases back to normal.

If multiple locations...
Use new uniforms at one location and old uniforms at the other. Compare results.

Bonus: Survey customers manually to see if they like the new uniforms better than the old.
Did the uniforms attract a certain customer base (younger/older etc.)?



__Will a new homepage improve my online exotic pet rental business?__

Hypothesize that the new homepage WILL improve business.
Will the homepage have any other effects on customer behavior (lead them to buy certain products / spend more time on the site, etc.)?

Have 2 versions of the site live at the same time.
Have 2 either fully random or evenly geographically distributed groups.
One group will see the old site and the other the new one for a period of time.

After this period, compare results between the two groups.

Collect all relevant information such as time on site, purchases made, etc. to make insights and determine which page is more effective overall.



__If I put 'please read' in the email subject will more people read my emails?__

Hypothesize that putting 'please read' WILL cause more people to read emails.
Will putting 'please read' in the subject have any other unintended results? 
Will more people read but less people respond? Will people respond more negatively?

Choose 2 groups of people. Both groups should include all demographics and types of relationships OR be completely random.
One group gets 'please read' in their emails and the other does not for a period of time.
Keep track of how each group responds.

At the end of the period, compile all relevant data based on others' behavior towards your emails.
Response rate should be the most relevant datapoint.
Be on the lookout for other things like response times or even length of responses to guage a brief vs thoughtful tone.
